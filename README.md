### About

A BTD6 mod that makes a quick start for your new throway/modding BTD6 account.

I call it LeeKnow because of Stray Kids's LeeKnow

And because I originally intended to only get unlimited monkey knowledge but got everything instead

***This mod lets you:***

- Set Monkey Knowledge Points

- Set Monkey Money

- Unlock All Extras

- Unlimited Tower XP

- Unlimited Powers

- Set Your Profile XP and Veteran XP
